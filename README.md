# A2

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.32.3 and little bit modified to support Hot Module Replacement

## Github Pages
This project is available on Github Pages [uctalks.github.io](https://uctalks.github.io)

## Development branch
Use `dev` branch for development. `master` branch is only for deployment of an optimized build.

## Development server with HMR
Run `npm start` for a dev server with Hot Module Replacement. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically inject updated code if you change any of the source files.

## Development server without HMR
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Deploy

Run `npm run deploy` to deploy an optimized build to `master` branch.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
